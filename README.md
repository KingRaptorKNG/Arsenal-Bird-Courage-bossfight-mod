# Arsenal Bird Bossfight
<∆>WARNING! This mod might have poor performance on less powerfull PCs! This mod features a lot of moving parts, entities and missiles! 32 render distance is recommended for best experience!<∆>

Have you ever wanted to have a large scale aerial bossfight like in Ace Combat 7 but in Minecraft? Now you can! Equip your elytra, prepare some healing brews and your bow, to be ready to fight the massive Arsenal Bird, codenamed 'Courage'! Be prepared for big amounts of drones, homing missiles and microwave energy, as this big bird gives a punch! Having trouble? Invite your friends to join the battle! (may have poor performance)

This mod adds the Arsenal Bird from Ace Combat 7, as well as its drones MQ-101s. It's a large scale aerial bossfight, with the Arsenal Bird periodically enabling its microwave shield. To defeat this bird you need to destroy all its essential parts, start off from its propellers, then its supply unit holding hooks, and finally the heart of this bird, the APS unit, located in the middle of the plane! Without supply unit, this plane can't enable its microwave shield anymore, so its a big opportunity for you to stick a fork into it! Each time you destroyr something essential, the bossfight stage changes. They're only 3 stages.

Stage 0:
The Arsenal Bird Courage is passive. To proceed attack any of its propellers or drones
Stage 1:
The Arsenal Bird releases 12 of its drones and every minute or so enables its microwave shield! To proceed, destroy all the propellers!
Stage 2:
The Arrsenal Bird again releases 12 drones and again turns on its shield every so often. The big danger reveal itself! There are now missile launchers located on the Arsenal Bird. They have been activated and are extremely dangerous, as their missiles deal more damage and track longer. You can destroy them, which is recomennded, as while they're active, they every 15 seconds launch missiles. To proceed, destroy the supply unit's hooks.
Stage 3:
The Arsenal Bird in desperate attempts decides to enable its shield and retreat, but without supply unit it can't maintain this shield and it turns off. Like before, 12 drones spawns and if destroyed, missiles launchers don't regenerate! To proceed and destroy the bird, destroy the APS unit, using the opening you created in the bottom. The APS unit is a cube in the middle of the plane. Destroy that and even the mighties Arsenal Bird will sure to feel it!

Tips:

This mod is not designed for survival, therefore there are no craftable spawning items;

Propellers regenerate slowly after stage 1, destroying them significantly slows down the Arsenal Bird;

Evading missiles is essential, to do that make sure your moves are unpredictable whenever a missile is closing in;

Good luck trying to beat the bird with elytra and a bow. Instead, you should use vehicle mods such as MCHeli or Immersive Vehicles or any other mod of your choice. You can find them on CurseForge.

To spawn the Arsenal Bird use the in-game spawn items in the dedicated creative menu tab! If you want to fully reset the bossfight, you should use specialised items for that. Don't forget to despawn all hostile entities with Peaceful difficulty. Example issues that may occur without resetting and despawning the boss: boss parts teleport away and return, boss parts shake (a lot), glitched out sound, drones acting odd. 

Also, the boss only moves in one direction. I tried making it to rotate around the spawn but it caused a lot of NULL crashes, I think that's the problem of MCReator non official 1.12.2 generator. I wanted to make the bossfight better, including drones flying better, maneuvering, custom APS particles and Helios, but again - MCReator non official 1.12.2 generator limitations. In some parts I had to use custom code. I hope you'll enjoy my mod, thanks for reading! 

<∆>WARNING! This mod may have poor performance in multiplayerr. There's might be hight ping, low TPS or server wide lag. Use with caution!<∆>
